# ethResearch
An area to store some basic research and work related to Ethereum. 

<b>pyEth</b> contains a small Python project with flask installed and some basic web3 operations to compile and deploy smart contracts on a basic test node. I was studying state channels and tweaked a UnanimousConsent contract which comes from the counterfactual framework just to familiarize myself with the build and runtime environment in Python.
